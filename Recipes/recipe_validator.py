# should validate all recipe json files to ensure:
# 1. structure is valid and contains all required fields
# 2. structure does not contain unrecognized fields
# 3. all field values are valid (of the correct type, make sense, etc)
# 4. all units are valid and recognized
# 5. picture file names are valid and point to existing pictures in Pictures folder

# create enums for Python for things that should be enums

# it's not well defined when ingredient names shouldbe singular or plural, ingredients should be enums too (names that only exist in one place)
